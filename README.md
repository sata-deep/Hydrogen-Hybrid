With this code, one can perform the hybrid machine learning, unsupervised learnig with Autoencoder (AE) and predict storage capacity via a MLP for a hydrogen storage data given in the file train.dat. 
Here are the description of the programs:
1. B1.py: Uses AE+MLP approach
2. MLP-B1.py: property predict directly with the MLP without any feature transformation.
3. Corr.py: Studies Pearson correlation between the latent space and the real features.
